    <p>This is our group project for CPSC-454</p>
    <p>The purpose of this program is to implement an app where users can create an
  account and upload their files to a cloud storage S3. In order to manage
  user accounts we will have a MySQL database that will act as an identity provider
  when new users make an account. The user's information and password (encrypted)
  of a newly created account will be stored in MySQL RDS. The program shall be able
  to authenticate user's credentials before using the services â€” uploading files
  and viewing all the uploaded files.</p>
